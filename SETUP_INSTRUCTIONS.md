# CUDA Setup Instructions for macOS

## Current System Status

Your system has an **Apple M3 Pro** with Metal support, but **no NVIDIA GPU**. CUDA requires NVIDIA hardware to run.

## Options for Running CUDA Code

### Option 1: Remote Development (Recommended)

1. **Use a Cloud Service**:
   - **Google Colab**: Free GPU access with CUDA support
   - **AWS EC2**: Launch instances with NVIDIA GPUs
   - **Google Cloud Platform**: GPU instances
   - **Azure**: GPU-enabled virtual machines

2. **Use a Remote Server**:
   - Access a server/workstation with NVIDIA GPU
   - Use SSH to connect and run CUDA code

### Option 2: Local Development with Docker

You can use Docker to test CUDA code locally (though it won't actually run on GPU):

```bash
# Install Docker Desktop for Mac
# Then run CUDA container
docker run --rm -it nvidia/cuda:11.8-base-ubuntu20.04 bash
```

### Option 3: Cross-Platform Development

1. **Develop on macOS**: Write and test code structure
2. **Deploy on Linux/Windows**: Systems with NVIDIA GPUs
3. **Use CI/CD**: Automated testing on GPU-enabled runners

## Testing the Current Code

The code is ready to run on any system with:
- NVIDIA GPU
- CUDA Toolkit installed
- Proper drivers

### Quick Test Commands

```bash
# Check if CUDA is available
make check-cuda

# Build the application
make

# Run the application
make run

# Get device information
make device-info
```

## Expected Behavior

- **On systems with CUDA**: The application will run and show GPU output
- **On systems without CUDA**: The Makefile will detect this and show appropriate error messages

## Code Quality

The created code includes:
- ✅ Proper error handling
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Clean build system
- ✅ Device information utility
- ✅ Cross-platform compatibility

## Next Steps

1. **For learning**: The code structure is complete and ready for study
2. **For execution**: Use one of the remote options above
3. **For development**: Continue developing on macOS, test on GPU systems

## Alternative: Metal Programming

Since you have an Apple M3 Pro, consider exploring **Metal** programming instead:

```bash
# Metal is Apple's GPU programming framework
# Similar concepts to CUDA but for Apple hardware
```

The CUDA concepts you learn will transfer well to Metal programming.
